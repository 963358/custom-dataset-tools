This is a repository filled with tools that I have personally created to help streamline my machine learning dataset processes.
In this repository you will find
- scripts to convert datasets into PASCAL VOC and COCO format
- a script to convert Pascal (labelImg) annotations to COCO json format
- a labelling shortcut key to help make life easier when annotating images with labelImg
- a simple script to help visualize the predictions of object detection models

I hope these tools help; feel free to let me know should any issues/questions arise.
