This is a repository filled with tools to help streamline machine learning dataset creation.
In this repository you will find
- [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg.git) shortcut script
- COCO format script
- Pascal VOC format script
- convert Pascal (labelImg) annotations to COCO json script
- renumber all images and labelImg (Pascal VOC) annotations to sequential integer order (eg. 0.png, 0.xml, 1.png, 1.xml, etc.) script

# **INSTALL**
First, make sure you have [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (only for Windows; Mac and Linux already have it preinstalled).

## Get Code
Open terminal.

Copy and paste (ctrl-shift-v for linux) the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CraigWang1/object_detection_tools.git
$ cd object_detection_tools
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```




I hope these tools help; feel free to let me know should any issues/questions arise.
