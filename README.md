This is a repository filled with tools that I have personally created to help streamline my machine learning dataset processes.
In this repository you will find
- scripts to format datasets into PASCAL VOC and COCO format
- a script to convert Pascal (labelImg) annotations to COCO json format
- a labelling shortcut key to help make life easier when annotating images with labelImg
- a simple script to help visualize the predictions of object detection models
- a script to renumber all images and labelImg (Pascal VOC) annotations to sequential integer order (eg. 0.png, 0.xml, 1.png, 1.xml, etc.)

I hope these tools help; feel free to let me know should any issues/questions arise.
