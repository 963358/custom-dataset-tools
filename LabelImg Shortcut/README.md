# labelimg_help.py
labelimg_help.py is a Python script that makes a shortcut while labelling images using [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).

Usage:
`$ python labelImg.py`

Once activated, go to your labelImg window and draw your first rectangle. 

Then, press the **"e"** key to automatically save the annotationn (ctrl s), move to the next image ('d'), and select the rectangle tool to annotate another box ('w'). 

Essentially, it makes the process go from 4 keystrokes/image to 1 keystroke/image, making it a much faster, more efficient, and more enjoyable process.

Once you're done, click on your terminal and press `ctrl c` to kill the script and exit.

Extra tip: Use the default class so you don't have to retype it.
