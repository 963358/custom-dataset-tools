# labelimg_help.py
labelimg_help.py is a Python script that makes a shortcut while labelling images using [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).

#### Usage:
```
$ cd "../../path_to_/Convenient-ML-custom-dataset-tools/LabelImg Shortcut"
$ python labelImg.py
```

Once activated, go to your labelImg window and draw your first rectangle. 

Then, press the **"e"** key. This automatically save the annotation, move to the next image, and selects the rectangle tool to annotate another box. 

You can also press the `r` key to zoom in if annotating small objects.

Once you're done, click on your terminal and press `ctrl c` to kill the script and exit.

Extra tip: Use the default class so you don't have to retype it.
